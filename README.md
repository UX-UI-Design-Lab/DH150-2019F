Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities DH150, UCLA 2019Fall

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course provides an introduction to the fields of UX research and design. It covers qualitative and quantitative user/usability research methods, including ethnographic field research, persona-scenario design, information architecture, prototyping, and usability testing. Students will learn how to design and communicate user experience design in the human-centered process.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES & LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:
- Apply a human-centered-design process 
- Evaluate a user experience design and elaborate related theory and principles in the context
- Conduct user research in qualitative methods
- Conduct usability evaluation in quantitative methods
- Develop user experience writings and visualization for interactive prototypes
- Document the design decision-making process with evidence
- Present the creative user experience design

## Final Project
### Goal:
Design an interactive prototype that demonstrates your ideas about how to strengthen user experience in health/clinic context. 

### Requirements:
- Should cover any health-related topics including mental health, everyday remedies (eating, taking medicine), or fitness as an example. 
- For any type of patients, caregivers or health practitionerâ€™s better decision making. 
- Strongly recommend to choose a self-related design problem. It is extremely helpful to have a close one in the context of design.
